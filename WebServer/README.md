#Comments to Evaluators#
 When attempting to access the scores for a particular player (i.e. "localhost:11001/scores/Toby/"), it is imperative that the clients includes the '/' after the name.

#Project Purpose#
This project provides the required classes for starting up a web server that will wait for incoming http requests from clients. When initially connecting, clients will be brought to the main page (assuming they had only typed "localhost:11001" into their browser). From the main page clients are provided with links to send new http requests that will change the page that is displayed. One example of a page that can be accessed is a highscore page that will display a table with the high scores for the current games stored within the respective database. More pages and possible http requests can be explored through the use of this console application.
